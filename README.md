# ALBION

Project ALBION is a suite of reinforcement algorithms aimed for the analysis on optimizing the load balancer in cloud environment. The work is still in progress

## LB Algorithms Tested

- Scheduling based
  - Round Robin
  - Throttled
  - Equally Spread Current Execution Load

- RL based

- GA based

## Tools (Tentative)

- [CloudSimPlus](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus-examples)
- CloudAnalyst (GUI for CloudSim)
- Rust [In Progress]
- Java
